					1. Which signs and symptoms should the nurse expect to see at the ankle and surrounding the abrasions? Why?
				</p>
				<p>
					Mrs. Morales is diagnosed with a sprained ankle, and she is taught how to walk on crutches. Before Mrs. Morales leaves the ED, she tells the nurse, 
					"I think my elbow is infected."<br/>
					1. How should the nurse respond to Mrs. Morales's statement?
				</p>
				<p>
					Two weeks later, Mrs. Morales follows up with her provider because she isn't feeling well. Her elbow is painful to the touch, hot, edematous, red, 
					and contains pus. Mrs. Morales' temperature is 100&deg; F and she states she is feeling "achy all over".The provider has ordered a CBC.<br/>
					1. What laboratory values should the nurse expect to see?

Class Activity 1:

    
        The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is a self-report tool that measures functional status outcomes in patients with various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It has become a mandated outcome measure for clinical trials in RA, as well as a helpful tool in clinical settings for assessment and monitoring of RA. Have students access the HAQ on the Stanford University Medical Center website (see &lsquo;Resources' below) and answer the following questions:
    


    
        
            How can the items in the HAQ be used to measure patient outcomes? The HAQ has been shown to be useful in predicting how well patients will do over the course of their disease and how well their disease symptoms are managed.
            As a health care provider, would you find this tool easy to administer? How could you use the information gained from the HAQ? The HAQ is designed to be completed by the patient as a self-report of their disease symptoms and functional abilities; it can also be administered by the provider during an interview. It is easily scored and provides a measureable way to serially monitor and follow patients with RA. Because the tool can help monitor patient symptoms and disease progression over time, providers can use the HAQ to help make informed decisions about treatment plans.
            How can using a consistent tool like the HAQ help provide quality and safe patient care? By using a reliable and valid tool for assessing functional outcomes, consistent treatment can be provided for patient populations with the same disease.
        
    

Reference: Access the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) on the Stanford University Medical Center website at www.aramis.stanford.edu to answer questions about its use in clinical practice

Class Activity 2:
Develop a chart comparing osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, including:
 Genetic factors
 Manifestations for each body system
 Priority diagnostic tests
 Priority management  medical-surgical
 Priority nursing care
 Interdisciplinary team members and community resources needed to ensure safety
 Priority patient education

Class Activity 3:
Develop a teaching plan regarding safety factors involved in drug therapy for patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis

Class Activity 4:Compare scleroderma with SLE.Use the acronym CREST to understand symptoms.Review the changes that occur in the skin, including those that may lead to contractures.Review the significant complications of this disease, including fibrosis of the lungs leading to pulmonary hypertension. Help students understand that changes occur in the esophagus, creating the need for changes in feeding and prevention of choking.

Class Activity 5:Identify gout as a disorder resulting from inborn errors of purine metabolism or as a secondary manifestation of another disease or factor.Present the three clinical stages: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, acute gouty arthritis, and chronic or tophaceous gout.Understand the significant pain of gout and the presence of tophi.
 Activity: Drug therapy is the mainstay treatment of gout. Have students develop a patient teaching guide for the drugs used in the treatment of gout, including indications and expected outcomes andside effects.Name foods that the patient with gout should avoid (also consider the need for increased fluid intake).

Class Activity 6:
Small Group Activity: For these less-common disorders, one disorder to each group. Suggestions are:
 Polymyositis/ dermatomyositis
 Systemic necrotizing vasculitis
 Polymyalgia rheumatica
 Temporal arteritis
 Reiter's syndrome
 Marfan syndrome
 Infectious arthritis
 Lyme disease
 Pseudogout
 Psoriatic arthritis
 Other disease-associated arthritis
 Fibromyalgia syndrome
 Chronic fatigue syndrome
For 10 minutes, present the disorder as it relates to the following points:
1. Brief pathophysiology
2. Priority symptoms
3. Priority management
4. Genetic cause

Class Activity1:
 Prevention of HIV/AIDS is a public health concern around the globe. HIV/AIDS prevention must take cultural context into account. Stanford University School of Education developed free materials that have been used around the world. TeachAIDS is a nonprofit organization that works to address and overcome the social and cultural challenges related to HIV/AIDS prevention education. TeachAIDS utilizes a rigorous research-based process to develop medically accurate, culturally tailored HIV/AIDS educational animations. In partnership with national and international organizations, and incorporating the voices of global cultural icons, TeachAIDS disseminates free animated curricula to educators around the world. TeachAIDS materials have been tested with tremendous success in numerous developing regions and are currently used in more than 25 countries, including South Africa, China, Canada, Botswana, India, and the United States. Look at the TeachAIDS website (see &lsquo;Resources' below) and bring to class resources that they can imagine using with patients.Access the TeachAIDS website at www.teachaids.org.
Note: most important aspect for prevention of HIV transmission is education, have students prepare a teaching plan for fivedifferent age-groups: high school, college, young adults, older adults, and health care workers. Plans should include specific information about transmission and methods for protection. When students present their plans, ask what factors affected their planned presentations.




Class Activity 2:Describe who should be tested and when testing should occur. Include a discussion on the nurse's role in pre-test and post-test counseling.

Class Activity 3:The care of a person with HIV/AIDS is complex. Take several of the problems (e.g., mouth sores, diarrhea, pain, dementia), and discuss best practice nursing care for these patients. Compare the care given to patients with HIV/AIDS who are hospitalized/at home/in extended care/hospice, etc. Include:
 Medication therapy (including medications that interfere with immune status)
 Nutritional implications (foods that provide best nutrients vs. foods that should be avoided due to immunosuppression)
 Pertinent priority teaching for patients and families (as applicable)
